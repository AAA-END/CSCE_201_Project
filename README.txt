This project is meant to be a recreation of the game "Snake" within the confines of the C++ compiler
output.

Please keep the Scores.txt file in the folder of the program.

If you wish to change the size of the game's grid, the size can be manually changed in the playGame()
function by changing the LENGTH and WIDTH values.
